        To create a puzzle, provide the dimensions of your puzzle and click on "Generate Board". Once you see the board,
        you can click or tap once on a tile to place an obstacle, and tap twice on a tile to place a player on
        the board. As you place the obstacles and the player, keep in mind that the player must be able to move over
        each grass tile on the board. When you're ready, click "Test Puzzle" to test
        your creation. Once you complete the level you've created, then it can be submitted for others to play!
